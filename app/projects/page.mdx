# Projects

I build product-focused software across backend systems, developer tools, and applied AI. I like projects that ship: real users, real constraints, and clean interfaces (CLI/API/UI).

import { Plaintext } from '@/components/project-logos'

## [<Plaintext title="Walker" />](https://github.com/ynbh/walker)

High-performance link analysis CLI built in Rust. Recursively crawls a website, discovers internal links, and validates them concurrently to surface broken or misconfigured URLs.

- Recursive crawler starting from a root URL; follows internal links across the domain.
- Concurrent `HEAD` verification phase to validate links quickly.
- Actionable output with HTTP status codes, timeouts, and error reporting.

## [<Plaintext title="Testudot" />](https://github.com/ynbh/testudot)

UMD course-seat monitoring + notifications in Python. Fetches UMD Testudo section data, tracks changes over time, and sends HTML email notifications.

- Tracks new sections, seat availability changes, and section removals.
- FastAPI server for health checks, listing mappings, and triggering monitoring cycles.
- Persistence modes: local JSON or Upstash Redis for cloud deployments.
- Dockerized builds using `uv` for reproducibility.

## [<Plaintext title="Snippet-Verse" />](https://github.com/ynbh/snippet-verse)

A "no-database" code sharing platform that stores shareable state via encoded URL parameters. Enables content sharing without third-party data hosting.

- Uses URL parsing to decode/encode shareable state.
- "Immutable" sharing model: URLs represent content snapshots.
- Deployed on Vercel.

## [<Plaintext title="ThinkWhy" />](https://github.com/ynbh/thinkwhy)

LLM-powered note organization CLI in Python. Automatically categorizes and files notes from an inbox into a structured directory using an LLM.

- CLI workflow to add/process/refactor/browse notes.
- Automated "inbox → taxonomy" filing powered by Gemini.
- Designed around a repeatable notes-management loop.

## [<Plaintext title="PlanetTerp Agent" />](https://github.com/ynbh/pterp-agent)

AI assistant for UMD course research. A chat-style AI assistant that uses PlanetTerp and Reddit to help research courses and professors.

- Grade aggregation and Reddit sentiment synthesis.
- Professor disambiguation using course context.
- Conversation export for sharing and reproducibility.

## [<Plaintext title="PlanetTerp Client" />](https://github.com/ynbh/planet-terp-client)

Typed Python client library for PlanetTerp API. Ergonomic helpers for courses, professors, search, and grades.

- Simple API: `course()`, `professor()`, `search()`, `grades()`.
- Supports identifying instructor type (TA vs professor).
- Includes OpenAPI spec and demo scripts.

### Other Projects

- **[Watch](https://github.com/ynbh/watch)**: Terminal-first show search + playback. A Textual TUI that searches TMDB, browses results, and launches ad-less playback.
- **[Rename](https://github.com/ynbh/rename)**: Batch renamer that walks a directory and asks a model for better file names. Useful for naming unknown image files, for example.
